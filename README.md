# My Cool Learning Journal

December 9, 2019 - First day of class kicked off with an introduction of the instructor Brian Nations. Then, we each class member gave an introduction stating their name, background, why they chose code fellows, and a brief fun fact about themselves. I learned about growth mindset in a nutshell, growth mindset is a continual process throughout life. In a world where things are always evolving you must continue to seek knowledge. Below are key learning objectives that were discussed.

**1. Setting up accounts i.e., Github, Slack, and Canvas**

**2. Markdown - a lightweight and easy to use syntax for styling your writing** 

**3. Professional Compentency Assessment**

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/damian253/wrichW/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
